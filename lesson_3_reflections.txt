When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want a remote repository when working on collaborative projects with other people or 
when I need to use a different computer to make changes. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually allows you to determine what changes you pull and when you pull them.
Allowing Git to do so automatically could mean that you get incomplete changes or a change that 
could break your project.
