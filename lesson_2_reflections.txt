What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository allows you set up a new repository with no commits. You will have to commit things before the repository is actually created.
It is needed to create a git repository and commit changes to said repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is different from the working directory in that is shows you which files you are about to commit to your repository. It differs from a repository in 
that it is not a final version of your program. It is only a place to add possible commits to your repository. It allows you to look at each item you are 
about to commit to a project and decide if you want to add or remove something. This way if you mistakenly add a file that you do not want to commit, you 
are given a chance to correct your mistake. Almost like an Are You Sure? prompt from windows and certain websites.
